# curated-web-data
A collection of "good and bad" Web domains for LLM pretraining data

## Types of Web domains

- good: Domains that can be used as seed for crawling and upsample for training
- bad: Unwanted content (noisy, spam, ads, adult, violence, pirate)
- duplicate: Dedicated and clean datasets exist (like Wikipedia, reddit, stackoverflow) - no need to use web crawls for these sources
